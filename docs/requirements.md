# Ice Cream Menu

Create a webpage that displays the menu for an ice cream shop.

## Objectives and requirements

To complete the assignment, you must:

1. Create a public repo in your personal Github account.
2. Create HTML, CSS, JS, and markdown files and add them to your project.
3. Push your code to Github.
4. Deploy your application to Heroku.

Bootstrap can be used if you wish, but it is not required.

Your code should store the menu data in JavaScript variables and loop through those results to build your menu page.

Your menu should group menu items by type and display them in different sections. 

You should apply at least basic styling to your menu page. If time permits and you are so inclined, you can go nuts and make something really schnazzy. :-)

## Data

Your ice cream shop's menu will have 4 types of products:
    1. Regular ice cream flavors
    2. Seasonal ice cream flavors
    3. Toppings
    4. Serving options

Examples of regular ice cream flavors:
    1. Chocolate
    2. Vanilla
    3. Strawberry

Examples of seasonal ice cream flavors:
    1. Salted Caramel
    2. Pumpkin spice

Examples of toppings:
    1. Chocolate sauce
    2. Marshmallows
    3. Sprinkles

Examples of serving options:
    1. Cup
    2. Cone

If you're feeling creative, you can make your own data set. If not, you can use projects.js.
    
## Application file structure

Minimally:

  app/
    index.html - menu page
    main.js - JavaScript code
    style.css - styling
  docs/
    requirements.md
  README.md
  Procfile
  package.json

Make sure there's something to read in your README file.

It's okay if your project has more files, but at the least you need the ones listed above.

## Remember to push to Github!

Your repo should be public so that others can see your code and comment on it.

## Remember to deploy to Heroku!

You will need to follow our example boilerplate to set up an Express server.

You will also need to include a Procfile so Heroku knows how to start your server.

## If you finish early...

Add interactivity! Here are a few suggestions (but feel free to come up with your own ideas):

* Make a shopping cart and add buttons that put menu items into your shopping cart.

* Calculate a total for selected products.

* Design a treat-builder that shows a cone or cup filled with the scoops and toppings the user selected.

## If you get stuck...

Ask. :-)
